# Acknowledgements

This framework builds on previous efforts to identify competencies and curricula for digital preservation, including the DigCurV lenses[^1] and the DigCCur Curriculum Matrix[^2], as well as a number of good practice models for digital preservation, including the DPC Rapid Assessment Model[^3], the NDSA Levels of Preservation[^4], the DLF Levels of Born-Digital Access[^5], and the Core Trust Seal[^6]. This framework would not exist without the hard work and wisdom of those who have produced the above-mentioned resources.

Thanks also go to colleagues within the DPC team and members of the DPC's Workforce Development Sub-Committee for their support, feedback, insights, and encouragement during the development of the framework and related resources.

# Introduction

The DPC Digital Preservation Competency Framework identifies and describes information on the skills, knowledge, and competencies required for successful digital preservation. Digital preservation is defined as the series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as necessary. It refers to all of the actions required to maintain access to digital materials beyond the limits of media failure or technological and organizational change.[^7]

The Competency Framework presents information on the skills, knowledge, and competencies required to undertake or support digital preservation activities. It can be used for a number of purposes, including:

- facilitating recruitment

- structuring professional development

- auditing skills

- reviewing curricula

The framework builds on previous work on identifying competencies for digital preservation as well as good practice models. This approach aims to reflect current good practice and a framework designed with flexibility in mind---to offer a balance of detail so that it can be widely applicable but still offer enough information to be useable by digital preservation practitioners across different organizational contexts.

**This framework aims to be:**

- Applicable for organizations of any size and in any sector.

- Able to support a range of workforce development activities.

- Preservation strategy and solution agnostic.

- Based on existing good practice.

- Simple to understand and quick to apply.

# How to Use the Competency Framework

This section provides a high-level guide to the framework and how it can be used. Additional guidance and use cases for the framework will be developed by the DPC. This includes the framework's companion resource, the DPC Competency Audit Toolkit (DPC CAT), which provides a structured process for individuals and organizations to audit their skill levels and assess current role descriptions. A set of Exemplar Role Descriptions have also been developed to help identify the skills required for different role types and different levels of seniority. Both resources can be found on [the DPC website](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/train-your-staff/dp-competency).

## Explanation of Terms

The terms "competency" and "skill" are used throughout the framework and its accompanying guidance, but it is important to recognize that these terms are not interchangeable. They reflect different levels of information conveyed within the framework. A competency relates to a combination of skills, knowledge, and behaviors that, when combined, allow an individual to perform the duties of their role. A skill is used here to refer to a more specific ability that can be applied to complete a particular task or reach a certain outcome. As is described in more detail in the following section, competency in a particular area is therefore achieved through gaining and being able to apply related skills.

Some of the terms used within the Framework may have different definitions or meanings depending on the individual and organizational context. Unless otherwise specified, they are intended to be open to interpretation by users to offer as much flexibility in application as possible.

## Overview of the Competency Framework

The framework presents information on the skills, knowledge, and competencies required for digital preservation in a hierarchical structure---from generic to granular---to offer as much flexibility as possible for users.

Its main structure, presented in Section 6.1 below, includes:

- Five high-level competency areas that offer an overview of and quick reference to the broad range of competencies required to undertake or support digital preservation work.

- Twenty-eight skill elements, organized in groups under the competency areas, which break down the competencies into more clearly defined units.

The high-level competency areas represent a broad range of interdisciplinary skills and knowledge, with only one of the five areas specifically referencing digital preservation. The other four areas cover issues relating to sustainable organizational infrastructures, communications, technological skills, and proactive management of legal and social considerations. While these four areas are not specifically related to digital preservation activities and are more general in scope, they are important for ensuring successful digital preservation at an organization. When assessing an individual's competency and skills in these areas it is, however, recommended to focus on the generic skill and not its specific application to digital preservation. For example, an individual who has extensive experience of developing and maintaining policy would score highly for this skill element, even if none of the policy work they had undertaken related to digital preservation.

The framework also defines five skill levels, representing a linear progression from an awareness of a skill element through to an in-depth knowledge and practice that would make an individual a leader in the field. These levels are defined in Section 6.2 and are as follows:

1.  Novice

2.  Beginner

3.  Intermediate

4.  Advanced

5.  Expert

For each of these levels, the framework includes examples of "activity descriptor" words that might be used in a statement describing a skill element in a role description at that level. For example, a novice in relation to Policy Development might be "aware of" policies at an organization, whereas someone at an advanced level would be expected to "develop" policy.

Section 6.3 provides supporting examples that further clarify the skills elements for each competency area. This section aims to provide information to support a range of uses of the framework, in particular in developing or evaluating role descriptions. The examples included are:

- Statements demonstrating how a skill element could be described in a role description

- Specific activities or tasks where the corresponding skill element might be deployed in practice

## Relationship to the DPC Rapid Assessment Model  {#relationship-to-the-dpc-rapid-assessment-model}

The Competency Framework has been developed to complement the DPC Rapid Assessment Model (DPC RAM) [^8] and also reflects a range of digital preservation good practice models. For example, the five skill levels mentioned above have been aligned with the five levels of maturity defined in DPC RAM (Minimal Awareness, Awareness, Basic, Managed, and Optimized). This helps facilitate crosswalks between RAM and the Competency Framework.

DPC RAM and the Competency Framework most closely align through the DPC Competency Audit Toolkit (DPC CAT) [^9]. DPC CAT has been designed explicitly for use with DPC RAM, requiring scores from a DPC RAM assessment to be able to complete an audit at an organizational level. As part of the toolkit, the key skill elements for each of the eleven sections of RAM have been identified as well as the skills levels required to support maturity levels for each section. DPC CAT, therefore, allows organizations to carry out a skills audit where they can input their current RAM maturity levels, and the target levels they aspire to in their next phase of development, and measure these against current skill levels across their staffing complement. For more information, please see the DPC CAT user guidance.

## Potential Uses and Their Benefits

The Competency Framework was designed with flexibility in mind so that it can be used for a broad range of purposes relating to workforce development. Some of those potential uses are detailed in this section, alongside the related benefits of using the Competency Framework. While individuals and organizations may already undertake some or all of the activities listed below, using the Competency Framework will help produce more robust and reliable results.

Potential uses of the Competency Framework, and their associated benefits, include:

- An individual wishing to benchmark their own skills as part of planning their professional development or against a post they would like to apply for.

  - Benefit: The Competency Framework will allow the individual to identify which skill elements are relevant to their current or desired role and if their skill levels match or if gaps exist that might be addressed by particular training or development opportunities. Thus, providing a clear and structured process for development planning.

- An educator looking to evaluate the curriculum of a digital preservation course they teach.

  - Benefit: The Competency Framework can be used in conjunction with the Exemplar Role Description for a graduate of an information studies program to complete a gap analysis of an existing curriculum or to help plan a new program. The Competency Framework ensures this process is well-structured and will help produce graduates who have the skills required to succeed in the workplace.

- An organization revising role descriptions for staff, auditing current skills across a team or department, and/or recruiting new employees.

  - Benefit: The Competency Framework can be used in conjunction with the Exemplar Role Descriptions and Competency Audit Toolkit (DPC CAT) to provide organizations with a clear and easy to understand methodology for auditing skills. The results generated offer a structured gap analysis that can then be used to plan professional development across a team, and/or the data required to build a business case for new members of staff. Working with DPC CAT results, along with the Competency Framework itself and the Exemplar Role Descriptions, can ensure the organization takes a structured approach to auditing skills that can be revisited and repeated as well as guaranteeing skills development is robustly managed and that there is consistency across role descriptions.

# Comments, Feedback and Revisions

While digital preservation as a discipline has been developing over the past two decades, it continues to evolve in response to external drivers and fresh challenges. New solutions, ways of working, and examples of good practice will continue to emerge. While we anticipate that the basic competency areas will remain relatively stable, it is likely that the skill elements and related examples will change over time. Therefore, we plan to submit the framework to a biannual cycle of review to incorporate developments in the field and in response to feedback from DPC Members and the wider digital preservation community. If you have any suggestions for updates or additions or would like to share your experiences of using the Competency Framework and accompanying resources, please email <info@dpconline.org>.
